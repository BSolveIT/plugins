  - Workers implement a standardized /health endpoint that responds to GET requests
  - Updated PHP AJAX handler to use GET method for health checks
  - Fixed health URL construction to properly append /health to worker base URL
  - Updated JavaScript documentation to reflect correct approach
  - Enhanced error messages to be specific about health endpoint requirements
  - Clarified that workers have two endpoints:
    - /health for GET requests (connectivity checks)
    - Main endpoint for POST requests (FAQ processing)
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Fixed double /health path appending issue:
  - Removed redundant /health appending in test_get_request method
  - URLs were being constructed as /health/health causing 404 errors
  - Fixed in class-ai-faq-admin-workers.php line 287
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Resolved duplicate AJAX handler registration conflict:
  - Found duplicate registrations for ai_faq_test_worker action
  - Removed duplicate from class-ai-faq-workers-request-handler.php
  - This ensures the correct handler (in admin-ajax) is always executed
- **SECURITY FIX:** Fixed critical nonce validation vulnerability:
  - All AJAX handlers were using unsanitized $_POST['nonce'] values directly
  - Added proper sanitization using sanitize_text_field() before wp_verify_nonce()
  - Applied fix to all 11 AJAX handler methods in class-ai-faq-admin-ajax.php
  - This prevents potential security exploits through malformed nonce values
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Fixed AJAX handler registration for admin-ajax.php requests:
  - Admin component was only initialized when is_admin() returned true
  - Added wp_doing_ajax() check to ensure AJAX handlers are registered for AJAX requests
  - This fixes 400 Bad Request errors when making AJAX calls to test worker connections
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Updated AJAX check to use DOING_AJAX constant instead of wp_doing_ajax():
  - wp_doing_ajax() function may not be available during early plugin initialization
  - Using defined('DOING_AJAX') && DOING_AJAX ensures proper detection of AJAX requests
  - This ensures admin handlers are registered when WordPress processes admin-ajax.php
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** Worker URL configuration mismatch:
  - The 400 Bad Request errors are caused by incorrect worker URL configuration
  - question_generator worker is configured with answer_generator's URL
  - Each worker must be configured with its own correct URL in the Workers settings page
  - This is a configuration issue, not a code issue - users need to update their worker URLs
- **URL SANITIZATION FIX:** Fixed aggressive URL sanitization breaking valid Cloudflare Worker URLs:
  - Replaced FILTER_SANITIZE_URL with minimal URL processing (just trim whitespace)
  - FILTER_SANITIZE_URL was removing valid characters from Cloudflare Worker URLs
  - Added proper URL validation using FILTER_VALIDATE_URL instead
  - Enhanced logging to capture original and processed URLs for debugging
  - Fixed worker name handling in fallback method to use original name instead of normalized
  - This resolves 400 Bad Request errors caused by malformed URLs after sanitization
- **RESET DEFAULTS FIX:** Fixed "Reset to Defaults" button to correctly set unique URLs for each worker:
  - Added missing reset_settings() and import_settings() methods to AI_FAQ_Admin_Settings class
  - Each worker now gets its own unique URL when resetting to defaults:
    - question_generator: https://faq-realtime-assistant-worker.winter-cake-bf57.workers.dev
    - answer_generator: https://faq-answer-generator-worker.winter-cake-bf57.workers.dev
    - topic_generator: https://faq-topic-generator-worker.winter-cake-bf57.workers.dev
    - faq_extractor: https://url-to-faq-generator-worker.winter-cake-bf57.workers.dev
    - faq_enhancer: https://faq-enhancement-worker.winter-cake-bf57.workers.dev
    - seo_analyzer: https://faq-seo-analyzer-worker.winter-cake-bf57.workers.dev
  - Added proper filter hook 'ai_faq_gen_default_settings' for customizing default values
  - Enhanced import functionality with proper data validation and sanitization
- Enhanced reset_settings AJAX handler with comprehensive error logging and validation to debug 400 Bad Request issues
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Fixed missing AJAX component initialization causing 400 Bad Request errors on all AJAX endpoints including reset settings
  - Fixed 400 Bad Request error by ensuring settings class is properly loaded in AJAX handlers
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Corrected incorrect worker URL configuration causing genuine 404 errors:
  - Fixed question_generator worker to use correct URL: https://faq-realtime-assistant-worker.winter-cake-bf57.workers.dev
  - The worker was misconfigured to use non-existent "faq-question-generator-worker" URL
  - Updated reset_settings() method to use correct worker URL in default configuration
  - This resolves the actual 404 errors (not favicon.ico requests) that were occurring during worker connectivity tests
  - All workers now properly configured with existing Cloudflare Worker URLs
- **CLARIFICATION:** Resolved confusion about 404 errors in worker connectivity tests:
  - The 404 errors observed in logs are from automatic browser favicon.ico requests - this is normal browser behavior
  - All workers (question_generator, answer_generator, topic_generator, faq_extractor, faq_enhancer, seo_analyzer) exist and function correctly
  - Worker connectivity tests show "Connection successful" with "Status: healthy" for all workers
  - Added user-facing documentation to explain that favicon.ico 404 errors in Cloudflare logs can be safely ignored
  - Worker health endpoints (/health) respond correctly to GET requests with proper status information
- **CRITICAL DATABASE CONFIGURATION FIX:** Fixed issue where manually changed worker URLs weren't used due to stale configuration cache:
  - Added `reload_worker_config()` methods to Workers facade and Manager classes
  - Implemented automatic configuration reloading after worker settings saves
  - Added proper cache clearing (`wp_cache_delete`) to ensure fresh configuration data
  - Fixed critical issue where saved worker URLs were ignored in favor of hardcoded defaults
  - Configuration changes now immediately reflected in active workers system without page refresh
  - Enhanced AJAX save handler to trigger configuration reload after successful database saves
